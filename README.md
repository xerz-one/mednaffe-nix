# Mednaffe for everyNix! ðŸŽ‰

This flake includes packages for `alsa-lib`, `mednafen` and `mednaffe` with
small overrides of the Nixpkgs originals, allowing users to have emulation with
working sound, no matter the system setup.

This flake was created so I could run Mednaffe on WSLg with an existing install
of AlmaLinux, but it should work in any other Linux thingie.
